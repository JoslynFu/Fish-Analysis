This project examines current data (1950 to present) on overfishing and fishery collapse. We compare our results to findings in the Worm et al. (2006) paper which first reported on fishery collapse and its implications for biodiversity.


## The Database
We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2542918)

```{r message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
#install a helper package to download data first
#install.packages("ramlegacy")
library("ramlegacy")
```

```{r}
#download and unzip files
#overwrite = TRUE gets most updated version
download_ramlegacy(overwrite = TRUE)
```

```{r}
ram <- ramlegacy::load_ramlegacy(tables = c("timeseries", "stock", "area", "tsmetrics"))
```

```{r}
#join the 3 data tables we need
fish <- ram$timeseries %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = "stockid") %>%
  left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c("tsid" = "tsunique")) %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid")

```


# Investigating the Decline of the North-Atlantic Cod

```{r}
#filter out only cod
cod <- fish %>% 
  filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua") %>% select(-commonname)       %>% distinct() 

#total cod catch on the Canada East Coast in metric tons
canada_cod_MT <- cod %>% 
  filter(tsid == "TCbest-MT", region == "Canada East Coast") %>%
  group_by(tsyear, scientificname) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue)) 

canada_cod_MT %>%
  ggplot(aes(tsyear, total_catch)) + geom_line(color = "blue") + theme_light() + labs(x = "Years", y = "Total Catch (MT)", title = "Trend in Cod Catch on the Canada East Coast")
```




Below is a similar figure from the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data.

Our graph has a similar shape as the one above, reflecting the collapse of the Canada East Coast cod fishery around 1992. However, our values are much greater than in the orginal graph because we plotted total catch per year rather than total landings. The landing value is the number of fish brought back to the dock, whereas total catch is all fish caught. Total catch is a much larger value since many unwanted fish are thrown back before reaching shore. Additionally, we used data for the entire Canada East Coast, which includes 10 subregions.

```{r}
fish %>% filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua", region == "Canada East Coast") %>% count(areaname)


fish %>% 
  filter(tsid == "TCbest-MT", region == "Canada East Coast") %>%
  group_by(tsyear, scientificname, areaid) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua") %>%
  ggplot(aes(tsyear, total_catch, col = areaid)) + 
  geom_line()
```

## Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](http://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/worm2006.jpg)
In the above figure, triangles represent cumlative species collapse and diamonds represents collapses in each year. For each, collapse is defined as catches falling below 10% of the recorded maximum.

```{r}
fish %>% 
  filter(tscategory == "TOTAL BIOMASS") %>%
  group_by(tsyear, stockid) 
```


We include only the data before 2008 in our analysis because the later record of catches is incomplete. Collapse is defined as total catch falling below 10% of the previous maximum total catch, measured in metric tons.
```{r}
#calculates whether or not species has collapsed in each year, and whether it has ever collapsed
collapse <- fish %>%
  filter(tsid == "TCbest-MT", tsyear < 2008) %>%
  group_by(tsyear, scientificname) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(scientificname) %>%
  mutate(current_collapse = total_catch < 0.10 * cummax(total_catch),
         ever_collapsed = cumsum(current_collapse) > 0) %>%
  ungroup()
```


```{r}
#328 is total number of species we have data on
total_species = collapse %>%
  filter(tsyear < 2008) %>%
  select(tsyear, scientificname) %>%
  count(tsyear) 

total_species %>% arrange(desc (n))
```


```{r}
#sums collapses in each year
totals_collapsed <- collapse %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(total_collapse = sum(current_collapse), cumulative_collapse = sum(ever_collapsed)) %>%
  ungroup()

#divide by total number of species to get a percent
percent_collapsed <- totals_collapsed %>% 
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(percent_collapsed_year = (total_collapse/328)*100, percent_collapsed_cumulative = (cumulative_collapse/328)*100)

percent_collapsed %>%  
  pivot_longer(-tsyear) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tsyear, y = value, color = name)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Fishery Collapse Over Time") + xlab("Year") + ylab("% Species Collapsed") + labs(color = "Legend") + scale_y_reverse() + theme_light()

```
Our graph, while not an exact replica of the Worm et al. 2006 figure, shows the same trend in stock declines. Around 1900, there appears to have been a large increase in fishing, resulting in a steep increase in collapsed species.

```{r}
#repeat analysis using stockid instead of scientificname
collapsed_stock <- fish %>%
  filter(tsid == "TCbest-MT", tsyear < 2008) %>%
  group_by(tsyear, stockid) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch_stock = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  mutate(current_collapse_stock = total_catch_stock < 0.10 * cummax(total_catch_stock),
         ever_collapsed_stock = cumsum(current_collapse_stock) > 0) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
#count number of stocks
total_stock = collapsed_stock %>%
  filter(tsyear < 2008) %>%
  select(tsyear, stockid) %>%
  count(tsyear) %>% arrange(desc (n))
#total_stock
#901 total stocks
```

```{r}
#sums collapses in each year
totals_collapsed_stock <- collapsed_stock %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(total_collapse_stock = sum(current_collapse_stock), cumulative_collapse_stock = sum(ever_collapsed_stock)) %>%
  ungroup()

#divide by total number of stocks to get a percent
percent_collapsed_stock <- totals_collapsed_stock %>% 
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(percent_collapsed_year_stock = (total_collapse_stock/901)*100, percent_collapsed_cumulative_stock = (cumulative_collapse_stock/901)*100)

percent_collapsed_stock %>%  
  pivot_longer(-tsyear) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tsyear, y = value, color = name)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Fishery Collapse Over Time") + xlab("Year") + ylab("% Stocks Collapsed") + labs(color = "Legend") + scale_y_reverse() + theme_light() + scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Cumulative Stock Collapses", "Stock Collapses Per Year"))
```
The same analysis using stockid yields a similar trend
