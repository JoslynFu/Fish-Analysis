This project examines current data (1950 to present) on overfishing and fishery collapse. We compare our results to findings in the Worm et al. (2006) paper which first reported on fishery collapse and its implications for biodiversity.


## The Database
We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2542918)

```{r message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
#install a helper package to download data first
#install.packages("ramlegacy")
library("ramlegacy")
```

```{r}
#download and unzip files
#overwrite = TRUE gets most updated version
download_ramlegacy(overwrite = TRUE)
```

```{r}
ram <- ramlegacy::load_ramlegacy(tables = c("timeseries", "stock", "area", "tsmetrics"))
```

```{r}
#join the 3 data tables we need
fish <- ram$timeseries %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = "stockid") %>%
  left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c("tsid" = "tsunique")) %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = "areaid")
```


# Investigating the Decline of the North-Atlantic Cod

```{r}
#filter out only cod
cod <- fish %>% 
  filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua") %>% select(-commonname)       %>% distinct() 

#total cod catch on the Canada East Coast in metric tons
canada_cod_MT <- cod %>% 
  filter(tsid == "TCbest-MT", region == "Canada East Coast") %>%
  group_by(tsyear, scientificname) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue)) 

canada_cod_MT %>%
  ggplot(aes(tsyear, total_catch)) + geom_line(color = "blue") + theme_light() + labs(x = "Years", y = "Total Catch (MT)", title = "Trend in Cod Catch on the Canada East Coast")
```




Below is a similar figure from the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data.

Our graph has a similar shape as the one above, reflecting the collapse of the Canada East Coast cod fishery around 1992. However, our values are much greater than in the orginal graph because we plotted total catch per year rather than total landings. The landing value is the number of fish brought back to the dock, whereas total catch is all fish caught. Total catch is a much larger value since many unwanted fish are thrown back before reaching shore. Additionally, we used data for the entire Canada East Coast, which includes 10 subregions, shown in the table below.

```{r}
fish %>% filter(scientificname == "Gadus morhua", region == "Canada East Coast") %>% count(areaname)
```

# Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](http://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/worm2006.jpg)

In the above figure, triangles represent cumlative species collapse and diamonds represents collapses in each year. For each, collapse is defined as catches falling below 10% of the recorded maximum.


We include only the data before 2008 in our analysis because the later record of catches is incomplete. Collapse is defined as total catch falling below 10% of the previous maximum total catch, measured in metric tons.
```{r}
#calculates whether or not species has collapsed in each year, and whether it has ever collapsed
collapse <- fish %>%
  filter(tsid == "TCbest-MT", tsyear < 2008) %>%
  group_by(tsyear, scientificname) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(scientificname) %>%
  mutate(current_collapse = total_catch < 0.10 * cummax(total_catch),
         ever_collapsed = cumsum(current_collapse) > 0) %>%
  ungroup()
```

To calculate the percent of species collapsed, we first found the largest value for number of species in a single year. We considered this value to be the total number of species included in the dataset. We chose this over species in each year because data was not collected or recorded for every species each year. This variation would lead to misleading calculations, since the percentage depends on the number of species in each year.  
```{r}
#328 is total number of species we have data on
total_species = collapse %>%
  filter(tsyear < 2008) %>%
  select(tsyear, scientificname) %>%
  count(tsyear) 

total_species %>% arrange(desc (n))
```


```{r}
#sums collapses in each year
totals_collapsed <- collapse %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(total_collapse = sum(current_collapse), cumulative_collapse = sum(ever_collapsed)) %>%
  ungroup()

#divide by total number of species to get a percent
percent_collapsed <- totals_collapsed %>% 
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(percent_collapsed_year = (total_collapse/328)*100, percent_collapsed_cumulative = (cumulative_collapse/328)*100)

percent_collapsed %>%  
  pivot_longer(-tsyear) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tsyear, y = value, color = name)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Fishery Collapse Over Time") + xlab("Year") + ylab("% Species Collapsed") + labs(color = "Legend") + scale_y_reverse() + theme_light()

```

Our graph, while not an exact replica of the Worm et al. 2006 figure, shows the same trend in stock declines. The red dots represent the cumulative percent of collapsed species, while the blue dots are the percent collapsed in each year. Around 1900, there appears to have been a large increase in fishing, resulting in a steep increase in collapsed species. The main difference between our graph and that of Worm et al. is that our values for percent collapsed species are much lower. This could be due to our use of newer, more complete data than was available to Worm et al. It is also possible that our calculations of percent collapse differ.


## Compare to results using "stockid"

We then repeated our analysis using "stockid" instead of "scientificname" to see if the observed trend holds using a different fish identifier.
```{r}
#repeat analysis using stockid instead of scientificname
collapsed_stock <- fish %>%
  filter(tsid == "TCbest-MT", tsyear < 2008) %>%
  group_by(tsyear, stockid) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch_stock = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  mutate(current_collapse_stock = total_catch_stock < 0.10 * cummax(total_catch_stock),
         ever_collapsed_stock = cumsum(current_collapse_stock) > 0) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Here, we used the same reasoning to calculate percent stock collapsed, finding the largest number of stocks in a single year and using this value as our total number of stocks.
```{r}
#count number of stocks
total_stock = collapsed_stock %>%
  filter(tsyear < 2008) %>%
  select(tsyear, stockid) %>%
  count(tsyear) %>% arrange(desc (n))
#total_stock
#901 total stocks
```

```{r}
#sums collapses in each year
totals_collapsed_stock <- collapsed_stock %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(total_collapse_stock = sum(current_collapse_stock), cumulative_collapse_stock = sum(ever_collapsed_stock)) %>%
  ungroup()

#divide by total number of stocks to get a percent
percent_collapsed_stock <- totals_collapsed_stock %>% 
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarise(percent_collapsed_year_stock = (total_collapse_stock/901)*100, percent_collapsed_cumulative_stock = (cumulative_collapse_stock/901)*100)

percent_collapsed_stock %>%  
  pivot_longer(-tsyear) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tsyear, y = value, color = name)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Fishery Collapse Over Time") + xlab("Year") + ylab("% Stocks Collapsed") + labs(color = "Legend") + scale_y_reverse() + theme_light() + scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("Cumulative Stock Collapses", "Stock Collapses Per Year"))
```

The same analysis using stockid yields a similar trend: stock collapses begin accelerating around the year 1900. This graph, however, shows a smoother trend than analysis based on "scientificname". We infer that this is due to differing fishing trends and regulations in different areas, which make trends in catch in any given area more stable than over the entire globe. The "stockid" label combines both species and location, whereas "scientificname" considers the species as a whole, which may recover in some areas while still being overfished in others. 

# Conclusion

This analysis of fishery data builds on Worm et al.'s findings and shows that fishery collapse is increasing and significant. Scientific attention should be directed to understanding the reasons behind fishery collapses and preventing future collapses and ecological catastrophe.
